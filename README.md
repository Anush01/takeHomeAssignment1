This is an MVVM inspired movie browsing app powered by theMovieDB api. As MVVM suggests it uses a viewModel object to abstract away a bunch of the stuff that
would otherwise clutter up the onCreate function of the MainActivity. 
It uses LiveData objects to communicate between the Activities and the ViewModel.

It uses a webView to simulate booking a movie. 

Install it and check it out. 


Thanks.
